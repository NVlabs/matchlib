Connections
========
Connections is a SystemC library implementing latency-insensitive channels for use by
high-level synthesis tools.

Doxygen-generated documentation can be found [here](https://NVlabs.github.io/matchlib/).
Additional documentation on the Connections
latency-insensitive channel implementation can be found in the [Connections Guide](doc/connections-guide.pdf).

Connections has been used as a component of the [MatchLib](https://github.com/NVlabs/matchlib) hardware component library.
For more documentation about compiling and running Connections components, see the MatchLib documentation.
