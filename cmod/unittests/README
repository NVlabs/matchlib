This directory contains unit tests and top-level module descriptions.

The number of design instances required to instantiate all possible template
parameterizations of the MatchLib component library would be prohibitive.  Here
we briefly describe the subset of design instances actually included in this
directory.

Most MatchLib components cannot be targeted for HLS directly because the HLS
tools cannot target templated classes.  Instances ending in "Top" provide an
HLS-ready wrapper around the named MatchLib component by selecting a particular
instance of the class.  These instances have been verified as valid HLS targets
by the Catapult tool, though only a subset of the relevant HLS scripts are
included in the open-source release.

ArbiterModule - Implements a SystemC module of roundrobin Arbiter with
latency-insensitive channel interfaces. Testbench tests the arbiter with 1000
random inputs.

ArbiterTop - Implements arbiter as C++ function. Arbiter can be configured to be
Static or RoundRobin using CFLAG: ARBITER_TYPE. Number of inputs can also be
configured using NUM_INPUTS. Testbench is configured to test different
specializations with 1000 random inputs. 

ArbitratedCrossbarTop - Implements an arbitrated crossbar as a C++ function.
Number of inputs, number of outputs, length of input and output fifos can be
configured using NUM_INPUTS, NUM_OUTPUTS, LEN_INPUT_BUFFER, LEN_OUTPUT_BUFFER
CFLAGs respectively. Testbench tests the design with random inputs.

ArbitratedScratchpadDPTop - Implements a dual-ported scratchpad with
configurable number of banks, dimensions of banks and number of read and write
ports. Testbench tests the functionality by performing writes to random
addresses followed by reading and checking results in random order.

ArbitratedScratchpadTop - Implements an ArbitratedScratchpad with configurable
number of ports, banks and size of memory banks. Request at each port can either
be read or write. Each bank services 1 request per cycle. If there are write
requests from multiple ports to the same address, the design does not guarantee
ordering of those writes. Testbench tests the functionality by performing writes
to random addresses followed by reading and checking results in random order.

ConnectionsTop - Tests various Connections components, including different
channel types.

CrossbarTop - Implements different configurations of MatchLib crossbar and
verifies them with random inputs.

FifoTop - Implements a FIFO and tests various operations in a FIFO including
push, pop, peek, incrHead, isEmpty, isFull, getHead, getTail using random tests.

LzdTop - Implements Leading zero detector function and tests it with random
inputs.

ReorderBufTop - Implements different operations in MatchLib reorder buffer and
tests them.

ScratchpadTop - Implements a scratchpad with configurable input ports and banks.
All requests are assumed to be conflict free and therefore, there is no
arbitration. Request can either be load or store. 

VectorUnit - Implements a vector unit that supports Mul, Add, MAC, Dot-product,
reduction, etc. 

WHVCRouterTop - Implements a wormhole router with source routing and multicast
support. Testbench verifies the design with random input sequences.

axi/AxiAddRemoveWRespTop - Connects AxiAddWriteResponse and
AxiRemoveWriteResponse blocks into a synthesizable target.

axi/AxiAddWriteResp - Tests AxiAddWriteResponse.

axi/AxiArbSplitTop - Connects a two-way AxiArbiter and a two-way AxiSplitter
into a synthesizable target.

axi/AxiArbiter - Tests a four-way AxiArbiter.

axi/AxiExampleTB - This test simply connects the AXI master and slave testbench
constructs, with no DUT in between.

axi/AxiExampleTBFromFile - A simple example of generating AXI requests from a
csv file.

axi/AxiLiteSlaveToMemTop - Implements a synthesizable AxiLiteSlaveToMem instance with 2048kB
capacity.

axi/AxiMasterGateTop - Implements a synthesizable AxiMasterGate instance and
test infrastructure.

axi/AxiRemoveWriteResp - Tests AxiRemoveWriteResponse.

axi/AxiSlaveToMemTop - Implements an AxiSlaveToMem instance with 2048kB
capacity.

axi/AxiSlaveToReadyValidTop - Implements a synthesizable AxiSlaveToReadyValid
instance.

axi/AxiSlaveToRegTop - Implements a synthesizable AxiSlaveToReg instance with
128 8-byte registers and a base address of 0x100.

axi/AxiSplitter - Tests a two-way AxiSplitter.
